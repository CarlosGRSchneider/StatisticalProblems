The Monty Hall problem is one of the most well known problems  in statictics, because of its background.
It is loosely based in the TV game show Let's make a deal, and its named after the game host, Monty Hall.

The problem was proposed and solved by Steve Selvin in the american statistician, one of the most imporant papers covering statistics,
but it really became popular with Marilyn Vos Savant's column "Ask Marilyn", in parade magazine.

The problem:
"Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. 
You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat.
He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?"

The solution is: yes you pick door number two, because there is a 66% of the prize being there.
Explaining why this is the case is beyond what I intend to achieve here, but it involves the bayesian theorem of conditional probability.

You can also check wikipedia for a more detailed statistical problem, the context where it was proposed, and all the outrage that came with it:

What I intend to demonstrate is that the answer is indeed correct, but using the law of large numbers, which proposes that if you play a game N, with
an odd of X, over and over again, X tends to normalize to P, the real probability of the event in question.

We will simulate 100.000 rounds of the problem, then see if it was worth to change doors, as proposed, or to stay with our guts, and HOLD THE DOOR.
