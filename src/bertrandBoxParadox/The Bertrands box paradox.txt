The Bertrand's box paradox is a statistical problem poster by Joseph Bertrand, in his 1889 work, Calcul des probabilit√©s.

The problem:
There are three boxes:

a box containing two gold coins,
a box containing two silver coins,
a box containing one gold coin and one silver coin.
The 'paradox' is in the probability, after choosing a box at random and withdrawing one coin at random, 
if that happens to be a gold coin, of the next coin drawn from the same box also being a gold coin.

The solution is 66%, though we normally guess 50%. Why is that?
It is normal to think that, since the silver box can't be the chosen box, and you have a gold coin at hand, you can either 
have another gold coin in the box(from gold gold box), or a silver coin(from the silver gold box).
But the gold box can have both of its coins taken from the draw: in the world of possible probabilities, there are 3 gold coins
and you are either:
a: holding a gold coin from the silver gold box, in which case there is a silver coin in the box
b: holding a gold coin from the gold gold box, but since there are two gold coins, you could have picked either:
b1: left gold coin, leaving the right gold coin in the box
b2: right gold coin, leaving the left gold coin in the box

This may seem counter intuitive, but we are going to use the law of large numbers to determine if we are right or not, so after playing
the game 100.000 times, the probability of finding another gold box should be the real probability P.
