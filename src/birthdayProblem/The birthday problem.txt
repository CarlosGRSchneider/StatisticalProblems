The birthday problem is another question that is found in Marilyn vos Savant's column, Ask Marilyn, in parade magazine.

This is the question:
How large must a class be to make the probability of finding two people with the same birthday at least 50%?

The answer to this questions is: 23. 
More often than not, people think that this is such a low number. We have 365 days for 23 people to have a birthday, and 
yet, we can get two people with the same birthday with less than 10% of the number of avaiable days.

To answer this question statistically, we have to sum the odds of two people having a birthday in the same day. I will use
a different approach, but you can read more about the problem(and its solution) here:

What I will do is:
have a list with 23 people
assign them random birthdays
make a set from that list
if set < list, then we have at least two people sharing a birthday
repeat 100.000 times

If we are to believe in statistics, this will return a probability greater than 50%. So, let's find it out.
